The epicenter was located 50 km north of Pithoragarh at a depth of 10 km, causing widespread damage in remote mountainous areas. Initial reports indicate 500 casualties with 2,000 injured, though numbers are expected to rise as communication is restored to affected villages. The National Disaster Response Force has mobilized 5,000 personnel with 20 teams already airlifted to affected regions. Army and Air Force helicopters are conducting rescue operations in inaccessible areas, evacuating 1,000 people so far. Major infrastructure damage includes collapsed buildings in Dharchula and Tanakpur, landslides blocking 50 roads, and disruption of power and communication networks. The Prime Minister has chaired an emergency meeting, announcing ₹1,000 crore immediate relief and deployment of mobile hospitals. International assistance has been offered with China, USA, and Japan providing satellite imagery and technical support. Seismologists warn of aftershocks continuing for several days. This is the strongest earthquake in the region since the 2015 Nepal earthquake, with tremors felt as far as Delhi and Lucknow.",

        "description": "Indian stock markets have crashed 10% in early trading following a global economic crisis triggered by simultaneous banking failures in USA and Europe. Sensex plunged 7,000 points to 85,000 while Nifty fell 2,000 points to 25,500 in the biggest single-day fall since 2008. The crash was triggered by collapse of two major US banks and emergency measures by European Central Bank causing panic across global markets. Trading was halted twice by circuit breakers as panic selling overwhelmed systems. Banking stocks were worst hit with HDFC Bank down 15%, ICICI Bank 12%, and SBI 10%. Foreign institutional investors sold ₹25,000 crore worth of shares while domestic mutual funds faced redemption pressure. Reserve Bank of India has called an emergency meeting while Finance Ministry assured markets of adequate liquidity measures. Gold prices surged 5% as investors sought safe havens while rupee depreciated to ₹85 against dollar. The crisis has wiped out ₹50 lakh crore of investor wealth with 5 crore retail investors affected. Global coordination is underway with G20 emergency meeting scheduled. Experts advise caution as volatility expected to continue with potential further declines.",

Political parties have collected ₹20,000 crore through electoral bonds since 2018 with 95% going to ruling party. The case has seen intense arguments about right to privacy versus public's right to know funding sources. Stock markets are watching closely as verdict could impact corporate-political relationships.

The test from Abdul Kalam Island off Odisha coast demonstrated ability to carry 10 nuclear warheads to different targets 8,000 km away. The missile features advanced maneuverability, decoy systems to defeat missile defense, and hypersonic glide vehicle technology. The successful test completes India's nuclear triad with land, air, and sea-based delivery systems. Defence Minister announced that the missile will be inducted into Strategic Forces Command by year-end. The development marks significant advancement in India's deterrent capability amid regional security challenges. International reactions are mixed with strategic partners welcoming stability while neighbors expressing concern. The test complies with international obligations as India maintains no-first-use policy. Technological breakthroughs include indigenous guidance systems, heat-resistant materials, and compact warhead design. The achievement represents culmination of 20-year development program involving DRDO, BARC, and private industry. Strategic analysts note this enhances India's position in global nuclear order while maintaining responsible nuclear stewardship.
