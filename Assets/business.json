        "description": "India's economy has registered robust growth of 8.4% in the fourth quarter of FY2024, maintaining its position as the world's fastest-growing major economy. The growth surge is driven by strong performance in manufacturing (12.5% growth), services (9.2%), and agriculture (4.5%). Key contributors include record GST collections of ₹2.15 lakh crore in March, highest-ever exports of $450 billion, and domestic consumption growth of 7.8%. The manufacturing sector benefited from Production-Linked Incentive schemes attracting ₹3 lakh crore investments, while services growth was propelled by digital economy expansion and tourism revival. The GDP at current prices stands at ₹328 lakh crore ($4 trillion), positioning India as the world's fourth-largest economy surpassing Germany. Per capita income increased to ₹2.5 lakh annually, with poverty rate declining to 5%. The growth is inclusive with rural demand growing at 8.1% and urban at 8.7%. The government has revised FY2024 growth estimate to 7.8% from 7.3%, exceeding RBI projections. International agencies including IMF and World Bank have upgraded India's growth forecast for 2025 to 7.5%. This economic momentum is expected to continue with inflation under control at 4.5% and fiscal deficit at 5.1% of GDP.",

        "description": "Reliance Industries Limited has unveiled its most ambitious investment plan with ₹10 lakh crore commitment to renewable energy and new materials over the next decade. The conglomerate will establish four giga-factories in Gujarat for solar panels (100 GW capacity), green hydrogen (5 million tons annually), batteries (100 GWh), and fuel cells (10 million units). The investment will create 10 lakh direct jobs and position India as a global leader in clean energy technology. Chairman Mukesh Ambani announced that Reliance aims to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2035, 15 years ahead of India's national target. The solar giga-factory will deploy perovskite tandem cell technology achieving 30% efficiency, while the green hydrogen facility will utilize electrolyzers developed in partnership with Stiesdal. The battery factory will produce sodium-ion batteries eliminating dependence on lithium imports. Financial analysts estimate this investment could generate ₹25 lakh crore revenue by 2035 and make Reliance the world's largest integrated renewable energy company. The announcement boosted Reliance shares by 8% and attracted partnerships with global technology leaders including Siemens Energy and Hyundai. This strategic shift represents India's largest private sector commitment to energy transition and supports national goals of 500 GW renewable capacity by 2030.",

        "description": "The Bombay Stock Exchange's benchmark Sensex achieved a historic milestone by crossing 100,000 points for the first time, reflecting India's economic resilience and investor confidence. The index gained 1,200 points intraday to close at 100,125.85, completing an extraordinary journey from 1,000 points in 1990. Market capitalization of BSE-listed companies reached ₹400 lakh crore ($4.8 trillion), making India the fifth-largest equity market globally. The rally was led by banking, IT, and renewable energy stocks with Reliance Industries, HDFC Bank, and TCS contributing 40% of the gains. Foreign institutional investors poured in ₹1.5 lakh crore in FY2024, while domestic mutual funds received record inflows of ₹2 lakh crore through SIPs. The milestone comes amid strong corporate earnings (25% growth), stable macroeconomic indicators, and continued reforms. Retail investor participation reached 15 crore unique investors with demat accounts doubling in three years. Experts attribute the sustained bull run to structural factors including formalization of economy, digital transformation, and manufacturing resurgence. The government celebrated the achievement as validation of economic policies, while RBI maintained stability through calibrated monetary policy. Analysts predict further upside with Sensex targets of 150,000 by 2030 based on earnings growth and multiple expansion potential.",
